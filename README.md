Hi! I'm a Unity developer passionate about building immersive gameplay systems and tools that empower faster, cleaner development.

📚 A lifelong learner and big believer in clean architecture, I spend time studying technical books on C#, software design, and best practices.  
Inspired by legends like Uncle Bob, I focus on writing code that’s as fun to maintain as it is to create.
