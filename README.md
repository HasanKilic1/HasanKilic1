Hi! I'm a Unity developer with over 4 years of experience as an indie and freelance game creator, focused on crafting immersive gameplay systems and powerful tools that accelerate production. I love bringing ideas to life with clean, scalable architecture and a deep focus on gameplay feel and polish.

ðŸ“š I'm a lifelong learner passionate about software craftsmanship â€” regularly diving into technical books on C#, game architecture, and clean code principles. Inspired by industry legends like Uncle Bob (Robert C. Martin), I strive to write maintainable, high-quality code that supports long-term growth and creative freedom.
