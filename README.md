Hi! I'm a Unity developer with 4+ years of indie and freelance experience, passionate about building immersive gameplay systems and production-ready tools.

ðŸ“š I'm a lifelong learner who cares deeply about clean code, architecture, and software craftsmanship. I regularly study technical books on C# and game development â€” and as a huge fan of Uncle Bob, 
I strive to write maintainable, scalable code built to last.
