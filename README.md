Hi! I'm a Unity developer with 4+ years of **indie** and **freelance** experience, passionate about building immersive **gameplay systems** and production-ready tools.

ðŸ“š I'm a lifelong learner who cares deeply about **clean code, architecture, and software craftsmanship**. I regularly study technical **books** on **C#** and game development â€” and as a huge fan of **Uncle Bob**, I strive to write **maintainable**, **scalable code** built to last.
